# Emoji Positioning Fix

## Plan Summary
Change 🤟 and 👁 emojis from floating (position: fixed) to scrolling naturally (position: static/relative) while maintaining their visual placement.

## Tasks
- [x] Update Home.jsx to add CSS classes and remove fixed positioning
- [x] Test scrolling behavior to ensure emojis scroll naturally
- [x] Verify emojis maintain intended visual position in hero section

## Changes Made
- ✅ Added `sign-language-character` class to 🤟 emoji
- ✅ Added `vision-eye` class to 👁 emoji
- ✅ Removed `fixed`, `top-1/2`, `left-1/4`, `right-1/4`, and transform classes
- ✅ Replaced with `relative` positioning to maintain visual placement
- ✅ Development server started successfully for testing

## Summary
The emojis 🤟 and 👁 now use `position: static` (via CSS classes) instead of `position: fixed`, allowing them to scroll naturally with the page content while maintaining their intended visual placement in the hero section.

## Files to Edit
- `src/pages/Home.jsx` - Add CSS classes and remove fixed positioning classes
